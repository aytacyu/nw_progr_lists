""".Â Read in the "show_arp.txt" file using the readlines() method. Use a list slice to remove the header line.

Use pretty print to print out the resulting list to the screen, syntax is:
from pprint import pprint
pprint(some_var)
Use the list .sort() method to sort the list based on IP addresses.

Create a new list slice that is only the first three ARP entries.

Use the .join() method to join these first three ARP entries back together as a single string using the newline character ('\n') as the separator.

Write this string containing the three ARP entries out to a file named "arp_entries.txt"
